## **ORDERED AND UNORDERED LINKED-LIST - IMPLEMENTS COMPARABLE AND ITERABLE INTERFACES**

##### CONCEPTS:
[LinkedList representation, implementing `Comparable<T>` for order, `Iterable<T>` for traversal, Unit Testing Development]

##### PURPOSE:
- `LinkedList` representation: creating an unordered-list with a node inner class to implement the linked list. It uses 
the field HEAD as the first node and null which represents the end of a linked-list.
- `Comparable <T>`   : overload the interfaces compare method and use it to compare values stored into the list.
- `Iterable <T>` : overload the interface's next() method to travel through the list.

### COURSE: Program Design and Data Structures
